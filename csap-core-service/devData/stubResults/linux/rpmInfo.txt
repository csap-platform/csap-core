Summary     : Multi-container orchestration for Docker
Description :
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker
applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your
application's services. Then, using a single command, you create and
start all the services from your configuration.

Compose is great for development, testing, and staging environments,
as well as CI workflows.

Using Compose is basically a three-step process.

1. Define your app's environment with a Dockerfile so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so
   they can be run together in an isolated environment:
3. Lastly, run docker-compose up and Compose will start and run your
   entire app.
